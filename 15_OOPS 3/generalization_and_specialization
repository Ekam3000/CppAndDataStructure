there are two purpose of inheritance-> generalization and sepecialization.

rectangle  
   |
cuboid
 here couboid is inheriting from rectangle , so rectangle is an generalized class, and cuboid is an specialized class

innova
  |
fortuner
same here

           car
      /     |      \
    innova  swift   benz

why did we achieve generalization?
ans->
           car
      /     |       \
    innova  swift   benz
 
 to achieve polymorphism , all innova ,swift and benz are cars . car is ageneral word for these all

 and the purpose of specialization is to share its features to its child class
