error
1. syntax error - compiler solves these error
2. logical error - debugger can help in solving the error, or u can find out your own created error by applying acurate logic 
3. runtime error -these error are created by users
example -> 1. bad input during run time it was asked to input a character but u typed a int.
2.inavailability of resources. (internet connection,need some files to run program,printer requirement for running our program)
so to deal with runtime error,exception handing is required..
exception handling with help the user to run the program if an erroe occurs by giving a msg that what kind of error occurs.


• Exceptions are Runtime errors
• Try and catch blacks are used for handling exceptions
• If exceptions are not handled then program may crash
• Exceptions must give a message to the user, giving correct reason on cause of exception
•
• A try block can have Multiple catch blocks
• Catch-All can catch all exception
• Catch-All must be a last block
• If classes in inheritance are used in catch block then child class should come first
