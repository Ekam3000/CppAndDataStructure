builtin class in C++ for accessing input output streams->
        iostream /ios
           /    \
     istream    ostream

 for accessing classes available  are
  ifstream     ofstream

  for input stream already there is an object made available in the iostream -> cin
  
  for output stream already there is an object made available in the iostream -> cout

  cin(keyboard) --> program --> cout(monitor)
                      |
                      |
                      |
                    file


insersion(<< is used for output) or extraction operator(>> is used for input)

Streams 
• I/O Streams are used for input and output data to and from the program
• C++ provides class for accessing input output operations
• Iostream is a base class for all classes
• Istream is for input 
• Cin is the object of istream
• ostream is for output
• Cout is an object of ostream
•
• ifstream is a file input stream
• ofstream is a file output stream
