file handling
-> text file 
1. int x=23;
the individual numbers are wriitten in cscii code
2->50 ;3->51
these ascii numbers are converted into binary number (8 bit as ascii number takes 1 byte storage)
50->00110010
51->00110011
so these binary number is stored in text files
if u open this file file in notepad-> then these binary numbers will be converted to ascii codes->int numbers and will able to see number 23 on the notepad.
for reading and writing from this text file u need just insersion and extraction operator.
2. these are slower , as these needs convertion.
3. this will take more space
->binary file
1.int x=23;
23 is converted to binary number. assuming int number takes 2 byte of storage 
0000000000010111 ,so this binary number is stored in binary file
if u open this file file in notepad then u will get junk characters.
for reading and writing from this binary file we need 
mode ->ios::binary
functions for read and write->
read(), write().

2.these are faster
3. this will take less space.
